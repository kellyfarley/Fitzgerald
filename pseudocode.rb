#GOALS
#sentence variety
#word choice (giving suggestions for stronger vocabulary or showing which words are used often)
#ending sentences in prepositions (this should be easy)
#passive voice (this should be relatively easy)
#repetition (although sometimes repetition can be good, it is usually boring)
#use of second person (if an essay is submitted...on this note, maybe different editing options based on what genre of piece was submitted)

#What genre is your poem?
	#Poem
	#Formal essay
	#Prose

#If the genre is poem, check for:
	#word choice
		#start off by checking for:
			#honestly
			#absolutely
			#very
			#went
			#get
			#really
			#literally
			#stuff
			#things
	#passive voice (but passive voice isn't always passive; if you follow it with a noun, it's ok, but if you follow it by a word ending in -ing)
		#was
		#were
		#is
	#repetition (if a word shows up too many times, not sure how to program this one)
		#ignore common words: I, a, the, that

#If the genre is formal essay, check for:
	#use of second person
		#check for: you, your, we, us
	#sentence variety
		#look at word after punctuation
		#look at sentence length
	#ending sentences in prepositions
		#if preposition is before period/exclaimation mark
	#passive voice (but passive voice isn't always passive; if you follow it with a noun, it's ok, but if you follow it by a word ending in -ing)
